## How I Got Here


For starters, my name is Camiyah Goins.  I'm a Floridian hailing from Tennessee.  I'm a college honors student, a new server at my Cracker Barrel, and I'm aspiring software developer all at once.  Days are hectic, and nights are worse.  But I never quit or give up.  I ended up here like I ended up in TN, by listening to my God's voice.  As a Christian, that means I'm crazy. But at least I do what I love and live my best life.

How this all started was by reexamining my goals and purpose. I'm in a community college because I want to have my own filming business.  Although I'm well on my way there, I also wanted to become a computer techie.  So I tried my hand on the Grasshopper app, which lead me to Career Karma.  After finishing my 21 Day Challenge, I wound up here.  All that was fun and all, but I really didn't catch the whole reason for the challenge until it was too late.  Everyday, once you check-in to CK, you learn some coding for a few hours.  I'm not sure why, but it hit me after the fact, not during.  Maybe it's because I think diffferently than other people.  Nothing wrong with that, but some things may go over my head.

Now you know more about me, remember I may not be present a lot.  Just because I'm silent doesn't me I'm inactive.  Let's break in and happy hacking.
